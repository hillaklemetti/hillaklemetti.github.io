    <h2> Health system design through resource allocation </h2>
    <br><br>
    My role: Health system designer
    <br><br>
    Focus: Health resource allocation, value based decision making, iterative design work
    <br><br>
<h4>PROJECT BRIEF</h4>
      <p class="borders">
        Brief: to design a health system in a resource restricted world. The given scenario was an area with no existing health infrastructure and we were given a scarce budget.
        <br><br>
        Method: play Health Resource Allocation Game (by KIT) in a limited time frame. First phase is the design phase and second  is the testing phase.
<br><br>
Challenge: decide wheather to ensure at least some level of help for most people, or ensure the treatment of a wider range of symptoms and deseases.
<br><br>
Goal: help everyone equally regardless of their socio-economic status.
      </p>

<h4>DESIGN PROCESS</h4>
      <p class="borders">
        1. Understanding the requirements and limitations for the game
<br> 2. Two approaches and four drafts created in total in an iterative manner
<br> 3. Pros and cons of each system, discussing values
<br> 4. Deciding on the final solution
<br> 5. Testing with patient cases

<h4>RESULTS</h4>
      <p class="borders">
The game allows us to get concerte results on how well our system worked (Tables below).
<br><br>
It would've been great to compare our results with another group to further analyze our performance.

<h4>MY CONTRIBUTIONS</h4>
      <p class="borders">
        This process was done in an intense manner around one table, where the whole group took part in all aspects of the process.
        My key contributions were insisting on a focus on preventative healthcare and especially for women's diseases which turned out to be beneficial.
        I worked as a negotiator between group members with differing ideas.
        In the reporting phase, my responsibility was calculating, communicating and analyzing the results obtained.
      </p>
<br><br>

<h4>LEARNINGS</h4>
      <p class="borders">
 Quickly digest new information and understand the restrictions of the game
<br> Make ethical decisions in a group setting with limited information available
<br> Discuss values to base our decisionmaking on
<br> Understand the holistic nature of health systems
<br> Iterative work
<br> Transdisciplinary team work
      </p>
