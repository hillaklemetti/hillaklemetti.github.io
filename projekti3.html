<h4>PROJECT BRIEF</h4>
      <p class="borders">
        Mission: Making Helsinki the #1 place for aspiring impact entrepreneurs.
        <br><br>
        Target group: Potential future founders (primarily university students and researchers)
      </p>
<br>



<br>

<h4>GOALS</h4>
      <p class="borders">
        1. Increased amount of impact startups and in effect meaningful careers
        <br> 2. An impact community that unites the university ecosystems, Aalto University and
Helsinki University as a part of a greater impact community.
        <br> 3. For daily discourse around entrepreneurship and startups to revolve around using entrepreneurship as a tool for tackling societal and environmental challenges.

      </p>
<br>



<br>


<h4>OUR SOLUTION</h4>
      <p class="borders">
        Wicked Helsinki - a self building community that enables this generation of founders and pre-founders to go tackle the world's wickedest challenges.
        <br>
        <br>
        Achieve above mentioned goals by inspiring and supporting. Activities done and in planning were a newsletter, podcasts, weekly meetings and an impact ecosystem map to name a few.
    </p>

      <br>

      <h4>OUR APPROACH</h4>
            <p class="borders">
              We began validating the hypothesis that there is not a true Impact ecosystem in Helsinki and there may be a need.
              Even though some activities around the topic of impact entrepreneurship exsisted, we couldn't find a thriving community.
<br><br>
              As an MVP we launched Wickedâ€™s newsletter directed to students interested in impact entrepreneurhisp which was well received.
              After consulting many stakeholders in the startup world and weeks of digging we came to the conclusion that there is a demand for further activities and connection points around impact.
