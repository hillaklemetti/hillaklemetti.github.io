    <h2> Strategic service design for Naisten linja </h2>
    <br><br>
    My role: Strategic service designer, interviewer, alternating project manager
    <br><br>
    Focus: Domestic violence, designing for a vulnerable group, Lean Service Creation
<h4>PROJECT BRIEF</h4>
      <p class="borders">
        Client: Naisten Linja, a non-profit organization helping women who face violence.
        <br><br>
        Brief: Naisten Linja wanted to improve their service offering. They wanted to strategically reposition themselves in the changing field.
        <br><br>
        Challenge: To explore how the service field looks and feels from the end-user's perspective. We were looking for gaps in the customer service map, where Naisten Linja could reposition themselves.
      </p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>OUR SOLUTION</h4>
      <p class="borders">
        Target group: Women who have separated from their violent partner.
        <br>
        <br>
        Problem worth solving: Loneliness after breakup
<br><br>
        Solution: A concept called Palvelukummi (Service Support Person) who would be responsible for being in touch with the woman who has experienced violence to guide her to the services she needs and support her by listening and being present.

                  <h4>MY CONTRIBUTIONS</h4>
                        <p class="borders">
                          I was involved in all parts of the lean service creation method.
                          I was alternatively the project manager.
                          I conducted multiple interviews and also transcribed other interviews.
                          I was in charge of vizualising the customer journey map and narrating that part of the pitch.
